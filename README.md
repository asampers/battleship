# Battleship

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Battleship, where you can play against the computer. The app is built using JavaScript, Webpack, Bootstrap, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles with Jest.

## Game Rules

The game is played on a grid where you and the computer place ships of varying sizes. Once the ships are placed, players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships to sink them. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Bootstrap
- Jest (for testing)
